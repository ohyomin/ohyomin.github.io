#### 문제
I face the probelem that Obx is not called, even if obs variable is modified in using GetX
```dart
// UI code
Widget _build(BuildContext context) {
  return Obx(() {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('${controller.size.value}'),
        Builder(builder: (_){ return Text('${controller.size2.value}');}),
        ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () { controller.size2.value++; },
            child: Text('button')
        )
      ],
    );
  });
}

// controller code 
class DropdownButtonController extends GetxController {
  var size = 0.obs;
  var size2 = 0.obs;
}
```
I expected Obx to be called because the value of size2 changes when I press the button, but there was no response.

#### Cause
```dart
Builder(builder: (_){ return Text('${controller.size2.value}');}),
```
Obx failed to monitor the obs variables used inside the builder.  
That is, because Obx observes only 'size' variable, it is not called even if 'size2' is changed

#### Solution 
```dart
Builder(builder: (_){
    return Obx(()=>Text('${controller.size2.value}'));
  }
),
```
It needs to observe 'size2' using Obx inside the builder

#### Additional analysis
Obx is Stateful widget
```dart
class Obx extends ObxWidget
class ObxWidget extends StatefulWidget
```
If it approach the obs variables in the process of performing Obx's build, it is added to subject in Obx
```dart
Text('${controller.size.value}')
// When approaching obs variable 'size' as described above, subject.add is performed by the following getter.
```dart
set value(T val) {
   if (subject.isClosed) return;
   if (_value == val && !firstRebuild) return;
   firstRebuild = false임
   _value = val;

   subject.add(_value);
}
```
In the case of builder, it is presumed to operate after the Obx widejet build is completed by Dart's asyncronized policy.
Thus it doesn't seem to add to Obx's subject.
```dart
Widget _build(BuildContext context) {
  return Obx(() {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('${controller.size.value}'),
        // 'size' is referenced during Obx build,
        // and it is added to the subject of Obx
        Builder(builder: (_){ return Text('${controller.size2.value}');}),
        // 'size2' is referenced after Obx build complete
      ],
    );
  });
}
```
